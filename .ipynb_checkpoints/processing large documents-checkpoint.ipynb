After I had been filled with fear by seeing my father play the\\nvillain’s part in such tragedies as _Die Waise und der Mörder, Die\\nbeiden Galeerensklaven_, I occasionally took part in comedy. I remember\\nthat I appeared in _Der Weinberg an der Elbe_, a piece specially\\nwritten to welcome the King of Saxony on his return from captivity,\\nwith music by the conductor, C. M. von Weber. In this I figured in a\\n_tableau vivant_ as an angel, sewn up in tights with wings on my back,\\nin a graceful pose which I had laboriously practised. I also remember\\non this occasion being given a big iced cake, which I was assured the\\nKing had intended for me personally. Lastly, I can recall taking a\\nchild’s part in which I had a few words to speak in Kotzebue’s\\n_Menschenhass und Reue_[2], which furnished me with an excuse at school\\nfor not having learnt my lessons. I said I had too much to do, as I had\\nto learn by heart an important part in _Den Menschen ausser der\\nReihe_.[3]',\n",

       " '\\nOn the other hand, to show how seriously my father regarded my\\neducation, when I was six years old he took me to a clergyman in the\\ncountry at Possendorf, near Dresden, where I was to be given a sound\\nand healthy training with other boys of my own class. In the evening,\\nthe vicar, whose name was Wetzel, used to tell us the story of Robinson\\nCrusoe, and discuss it with us in a highly instructive manner. I was,\\nmoreover, much impressed by a biography of Mozart which was read aloud;\\nand the newspaper accounts and monthly reports of the events of the\\nGreek War of Independence stirred my imagination deeply. My love for\\nGreece, which afterwards made me turn with enthusiasm to the mythology\\nand history of ancient Hellas, was thus the natural outcome of the\\nintense and painful interest I took in the events of this period. In\\nafter years the story of the struggle of the Greeks against the\\nPersians always revived my impressions of this modern revolt of Greece\\nagainst the Turks.',\n",
       " 'One day, when I had been in this country home scarcely a year, a\\nmessenger came from town to ask the vicar to take me to my parents’\\nhouse in Dresden, as my father was dying.',\n",
       " 'We did the three hours’ journey on foot; and as I was very exhausted\\nwhen I arrived, I scarcely understood why my mother was crying. The\\nnext day I was taken to my father’s bedside; the extreme weakness with\\nwhich he spoke to me, combined with all the precautions taken in the\\nlast desperate treatment of his complaint—acute hydrothorax—made the\\nwhole scene appear like a dream to me, and I think I was too frightened\\nand surprised to cry.']"
