      "included, led to a clearer understanding of the character of the\n",

      "people hitherto unknown to me. Jessie, as the young wife was called at\n",

      "soon as the news of my difficulties had reached the Ritters, a\n",
      "correspondence had been carried on between Dresden and Bordeaux with a\n",
      "view to ascertaining how best to assist me. Jessie attributed the whole\n",
      "idea to Frau Julie Ritter who, while not being well enough off herself\n",
      "to make me a sufficient allowance, was endeavouring to come to an\n",
      "understanding with Jessie’s mother, the well-to-do widow of an English\n",

      "This plan had so far succeeded, that shortly after my arrival in\n",
      "Bordeaux Mrs. Taylor informed me that the two families had combined,\n",
      "and that it had been decided to ask me to accept the help of three\n",
      "thousand francs a year until the return of better days. My one object\n",
      "now was to enlighten my benefactors as to the exact conditions under\n",
      "which I should be accepting such assistance. I could no longer reckon\n",
      "upon achieving any success as a composer of opera either in Paris or\n",
      "elsewhere; what line I should take up instead I did not know; but, at\n",
      "all events, I was determined to keep myself free from the disgrace\n",
      "which would reflect upon my whole life if I used such means as this\n",
      "offer presented to secure success. I feel sure I am not wrong in\n",
      "believing that Jessie was the only one who understood me, and though I\n",
      "only experienced kindness from the rest of the family, I soon\n",
      "discovered the gulf by which she, as well as myself, was separated from\n",
      "her mother and husband. While the husband, who was a handsome young\n",
      "man, was away the greater part of the day attending to his business,\n",
      "and the mother’s deafness excluded her to a great extent from our\n",
      "conversations, we soon discovered by a rapid exchange of ideas that we\n",
      "shared the same opinions on many important matters, and this led to a\n",
      "great feeling of friendship between us. Jessie, who was at that time\n",
      "about twenty-two, bore little resemblance to her mother, and no doubt\n",
      "took after her father, of whom I heard most flattering accounts. A\n",
      "large and varied collection of books loft by this man to his daughter\n",
      "showed his tastes, for besides carrying on his lucrative profession as\n",
      "a lawyer, he had devoted himself to the study of literature and\n",
      "science. From him Jessie had also learned German as a child, and she\n",
      "spoke that language with great fluency. She had been brought up on\n",
      "Grimm’s fairy-tales, and was, moreover, thoroughly acquainted with\n",
      "German poetry, as well as with that of England and France, and her\n",
      "knowledge of them was as thorough as the most advanced education could\n",
      "demand. French literature did not appeal to her much. Her quick powers\n",
      "of comprehension were astonishing. Everything which I touched upon she\n",
      "immediately grasped and assimilated. It was the same with music: she\n",
      "read at sight with the greatest facility, and was an accomplished\n",
      "player. During her stay in Dresden she had been told that I was still\n",
      "in search of the pianist who could play Beethoven’s great Sonata in B\n",
      "flat major, and she now astonished me by her finished rendering of this\n",
      "most difficult piece. The emotion aroused in me by finding such an\n",
      "exceptionally developed talent suddenly changed to anxiety when I heard\n",
      "her sing. Her sharp, shrill voice, in which there was strength but no\n",
      "real depth of feeling, so shocked me that I could not refrain from\n",
      "begging her to desist from singing in future. With regard to the\n",
      "execution of the sonata, she listened eagerly to my instructions as to\n",
      "how it should be interpreted, though I could not feel that she would\n",
      "succeed in rendering it according to my ideas. I read her my latest\n",
      "essays, and she seemed to understand even the most extraordinary\n",
      "descriptions perfectly. My poem on Siegfried’s Tod moved her deeply,\n",
      "but she preferred my sketch of Wieland der Schmied. She admitted\n",
      "afterwards that she would prefer to imagine herself filling the role of\n",
      "Wieland’s worthy bride than to find herself in the position and forced\n",
      "to endure the fate of Gutrune in Siegfried. It followed inevitably that\n",
      "the presence of the other members of the family proved embarrassing\n",
      "when we wanted to talk over and discuss these various subjects. If we\n",
      "felt somewhat troubled at having to confess to ourselves that Mrs.\n",
      "Taylor would certainly never be able to understand why I was being\n",
      "offered assistance, I was still more disconcerted at realising after a\n",
      "time the complete want of harmony between the young couple,\n",
      "particularly from an intellectual point of view. The fact that Laussot\n",
      "had for some time been well aware of his wife’s dislike for him was\n",
      "plainly shown when he one day so far forgot himself as to complain\n",
      "loudly and bitterly that she would not even love a child of his if she\n",
      "had one, and that he therefore thought it fortunate that she was not a\n",
      "mother. Astonished and saddened, I suddenly gazed into an abyss which\n",
      "was hidden here, as is often the case, under the appearance of a\n",
      "tolerably happy married life. About this time, and just as my visit,\n",
      "which had already lasted three weeks, was drawing to a close, I\n",
      "received a letter from my wife that could not have had a more\n",
      "unfortunate effect on my state of mind. She was, on the whole, pleased\n",
      "at my having found new friends, but at the same time explained that if\n",
      "I did not immediately return to Paris, and there endeavour to secure\n",
      "the production of my overture with the results anticipated, she would\n",
      "not know what to think of me, and would certainly fail to understand me\n",
      "if I returned to Zürich without having effected my purpose. At the same\n",
      "time my depression was intensified in a terrible way by a notice in the\n",
      "papers announcing that Röckel, Bakunin, and Heubner had been sentenced\n",
      "to death, and that the date of their execution was fixed. I wrote a\n",
      "short but stirring letter of farewell to the two first, and as I saw no\n",
      "possibility of having it conveyed to the prisoners, who were confined\n",
      "in the fortress of Konigstein, I decided to send it to Frau von\n",
      "Lüttichau, to be forwarded to them by her, because I thought she was\n",
      "the only person in whose power it might lie to do this for me, while at\n",
      "the same time she had sufficient generosity and independence of mind to\n",
      "enable her to respect and carry out my wishes, in spite of any possible\n",
      "difference of opinion she might entertain. I was told some time\n",
      "afterwards that Lüttichau had got hold of the letter and thrown it into\n",
      "the fire. For the time being this painful impression helped me to the\n",
      "determination to break with every one and everything, to lose all\n",
      "desire to learn more of life or of art, and, even at the risk of having\n",
      "to endure the greatest privations, to trust to chance and put myself\n",
      "beyond the reach of everybody. The small income settled upon me by my\n",

      "enlighten my benefactors as to how I intended disposing of the income\n",

      "to abandon herself to the same fate seemed to her also, in her\n",
      "resentment against her position, to be quite an easy matter. She\n",
      "expressed us much by hints and a word dropped here and there. Without\n",
      "clearly realising what it would lead to, and without coming to any\n",
      "understanding with her, I left Bordeaux towards the end of April, more\n",
      "excited than soothed in spirit, and filled with regret and anxiety. I\n",
      "returned to Paris, for the time being, stunned and full of uncertainty\n",
      "as to what to do next. Feeling very unwell, exhausted, and at the same\n",
      "time excited from want of sleep, I reached my destination and put up at\n",
      "the Hotel Valois, where I remained a week, struggling to gain my\n",
      "self-control and to face my strange position. Even if I had wished to\n",
      "resume the plans which had been instrumental in bringing me to Paris, I\n",

      "filled with distress and anger at being called upon to waste my\n",
      "energies in a direction contrary to my tastes, merely to satisfy the\n",
      "unreasonable demands made upon me. I was at length obliged to answer my\n",
      "wife’s last pressing communication, and wrote her a long and detailed\n",
      "letter in which I kindly, but at the same time frankly, retraced the\n",
      "whole of our life together, and explained that I was fully determined\n",
      "to set her free from any immediate participation in my fate, as I felt\n",
      "quite incapable of so arranging it so as to meet with her approval. I\n",
      "promised her the half of whatever means I should have at my disposal\n",
      "now or in the future, and told her she must accept this arrangement\n",
      "with a good grace, because the occasion had now arisen to take that\n",
      "step of parting from me which, on our first meeting again in\n",
      "Switzerland, she had declared herself ready to do. I ended my letter\n",
      "without bidding her a final farewell. I thereupon wrote to Bordeaux\n",
      "immediately to inform Jessie of the step I had taken, though my means\n",
      "did not as yet allow of my forming any definite plan which I could\n",
      "communicate to her for my complete flight from the world. In return she\n",
      "announced that she was determined to do likewise, and asked for my\n",
      "protection, under which she intended to place herself when once she had\n",
      "set herself free. Much alarmed, I did all in my power to make her\n",
      "realise that it was one thing for a man, placed in such a desperate\n",
      "situation as myself, to cut himself adrift in the face of\n",
      "insurmountable difficulties, but quite another matter for a young\n",
      "woman, at least to all outward appearances, happily settled, to decide\n",
      "to break up her home, for reasons which probably no one except myself\n",
      "would be in a position to understand. Regarding the unconventionality\n",
      "of her resolve in the eyes of the world, she assured me that it would\n",
      "be carried out as quietly as possible, and that for the present she\n",
      "merely thought of arranging to visit her friends the Ritters in\n",
      "Dresden. I felt so upset by all this that I yielded to my craving for\n",
      "retirement, and sought it at no great distance from Paris. Towards the\n",
      "middle of April I went to Montmorency, of which I had heard many\n",
      "agreeable accounts, and there sought a modest hiding-place. With great\n",
      "difficulty I dragged myself to the outskirts of the little town, where\n",
      "the country still bore a wintry aspect, and turned into the little\n",
      "strip of garden belonging to a wine merchant, which was filled with\n",
      "visitors only on Sundays, and there refreshed myself with some bread\n",
      "and cheese and a bottle of wine. A crowd of hens surrounded me, and I\n",
      "kept throwing them pieces of bread, and was touched by the\n",
      "self-sacrificing abstemiousness with which the cock gave all to his\n",
      "wives though I aimed particularly at him. They became bolder and\n",
      "bolder, and finally flew on to the table and attacked my provisions;\n",
      "the cock flew after them, and noticing that everything was topsy-turvy,\n",
      "pounced upon the cheese with the eagerness of a craving long\n",
      "unsatisfied. When I found myself being driven from the table by this\n",
      "chaos of fluttering wings, I was filled with a gaiety to which I had\n",
      "long been a stranger. I laughed heartily, and looked round for the\n",
      "signboard of the inn. I thereby discovered that my host rejoiced in the\n",
      "name of Homo. This seemed a hint from Fate, and I felt I must seek\n",
      "shelter here at all costs. An extraordinarily small and narrow bedroom\n",
      "was shown me, which I immediately engaged. Besides the bed it held a\n",
      "rough table and two cane-bottomed chairs. I arranged one of these as a\n",
      "washhand-stand, and on the table I placed some books, writing\n",
      "materials, and the score of Lohengrin, and almost heaved a sigh of\n",
      "content in spite of my extremely cramped accommodation. Though the\n",
      "weather remained uncertain and the woods with their leafless trees did\n",
      "not seem to offer the prospect of very enticing walks, I still felt\n",
      "that here there was a possibility of my being forgotten, and being also\n",
      "in my turn allowed to forget the events that had lately filled me with\n",
      "Midi desperate anxiety. My old artistic instinct awoke again. I looked\n",
      "over my Lohengrin score, and quickly decided to send it to Liszt and\n",
      "leave it to him to bring it out as best he could. Now that I had got\n",
      "rid of this score also, I felt as free as a bird and as careless as\n",
      "Diogenes about what might befall me. I even invited Kietz to come and\n",
